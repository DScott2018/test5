    <hr>
    My name is David Scott. I am a senior at Georgia Southern University pursuing a bachelor's degree in computer science. During my time in school I have worked with a handfull of different programming languages that have taught me how writing code works. I have gained a strong understanding of using Java, C, C++, and SQL. Though these are the languages I have used in school, I have also used other languages outside of school such as Lua, MATLAB, and C#. I also have experience with data structures, algorithm analysis, and the software development lifecycle. I am a highly creative person who is eager and open to learn more in any niche I find myself in. I am a fast learner who can quickly figure out problems that I come across. I am currently seeking employment so I can further my experience in programming and grow as a professional.

    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <h3>Packet Capturer</h3>
    <p>
            I have worked on a few projects that I believe showcase the skills necessary for employment. Most recently, I created a C# project that is used for packet capturing. There is a dropdown menu that lets the user select the network adapter so he/she can monitor traffic coming in. This project also allows the use of user generated ARP requests, all they need to do is select a text file with a properly formatted ARP request and the console will send it out for them. Using Wireshark, you can watch as your request is sent out. This project took a few weeks to finish, as I had never worked with packet capturing before. Regardless, I think the final version of this project turned out better than expected.

    <h3>Key Logger</h3>
    <p>
        As part of my computer security class I was tasked with writing a research paper over any topic of my choice related to security. I chose to focus on researching different types of attacks that hackers might use to steal personal information. I wanted to show how easy it is to make some of these attacks, which is when I started to work on a key logger. I used Java for this project along with an extra .jar file called jNativeHook. This .jar allows this project to track whatever I type even if I am not using the IDE. This relatively simple script is meant to run in the background and record everything that a person types into a text file. That text file is then automatically sent to an e-mail every 10 minutes. I used Python to set up the e-mail automation as Python allows for e-mail registration and automatic sending. This project was a bit more in depth as I do not have as much experience with Python, and the text files can be a bit long. Overall I am happy with the result and feel as if this project deserves some acknowledgement.
